# Annual Stock Analysis for 2017/8

## Overview of Project
This analysis reviewed annual growth in selected stocks over a 2 year period.  Each stock had daily open and closing prices as well as volume traded.   This basic data was used to identify year over year valuations.
The project also offered a way to understand loops in code and the ability to refactor code for better efficiency.
